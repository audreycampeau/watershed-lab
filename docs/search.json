    "text": "Welcome\nThe Watershed Lab is an interdisciplinary research group studying watershed processes, with focus on biogeochemistry and hydrology. We want to understand how watershed processes operate, and how they may respond to and shape environmental changes.\nWhat is a watershed? It is the geospatial scale that is defined by the natural flow of water on land. This scale provides a unit for understanding flows of matter and physical processes on land. It’s greatest strenght is its interconnecteness - one effect upstream can be perceived over kilometers downstreams.\nOur research is based mostly on field observations and combines multiple tools including automated and continuous in-situ sensor measurements, isotopic tracers, ground or drone-based imagery including, RGB, thermal infrared images and LIDAR.\nWe are based at the departement of geography of University of Montréal, located at Campus-MIL"
