   abstract = {The Arctic environment harbors a complex mosaic of mercury (Hg) and carbon (C) reservoirs, some of which are rapidly destabilizing in response to climate warming. The sources of riverine Hg across the Mackenzie River basin (MRB) are uncertain, which leads to a poor understanding of potential future release. Measurements of dissolved and particulate mercury (DHg, PHg) and carbon (DOC, POC) concentration were performed, along with analyses of Hg stable isotope ratios (incl. (199)Hg, delta(202)Hg), radiocarbon content ((14)C) and optical properties of DOC of river water. Isotopic ratios of Hg revealed a closer association to terrestrial Hg reservoirs for the particulate fraction, while the dissolved fraction was more closely associated with atmospheric deposition sources of shorter turnover time. There was a positive correlation between the (14)C-OC and riverine Hg concentration for both particulate and dissolved fractions, indicating that waters transporting older-OC ((14)C-depleted) also contained higher levels of Hg. In the dissolved fraction, older DOC was also associated with higher molecular weight, aromaticity and humic content, which are likely associated with higher Hg-binding potential. Riverine PHg concentration increased with turbidity and SO(4) concentration. There were large contrasts in Hg concentration and OC age and quality among the mountain and lowland sectors of the MRB, which likely reflect the spatial distribution of various terrestrial Hg and OC reservoirs, including weathering of sulfate minerals, erosion and extraction of coal deposits, thawing permafrost, forest fires, peatlands, and forests. Results revealed major differences in the sources of particulate and dissolved riverine Hg, but nonetheless a common positive association with older riverine OC. These findings reveal that a complex mixture of Hg sources, supplied across the MRB, will contribute to future trends in Hg export to the Arctic Ocean under rapid environmental changes.},

   abstract = {Arctic rivers deliver ~40 t yr(-1) of mercury (Hg) to the Arctic Ocean, ~6 % of which is from the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB), a region warming at ~3 times the mean hemispheric rate. How this will affect Hg transfer to ecosystems of the Beaufort Sea is a worrying issue. To help address this question, we analyzed >500 measurements of Hg and other water properties from 22 rivers collected in 2012-2018 by communities of the MRB. This new dataset provides a more comprehensive view of riverine Hg variations across the basin than was previously available. We find that rivers issued from mountains in the western MRB contribute the largest share of Hg in the Mackenzie River, 60-95 % of it being carried as fine suspended solids and probably sourced from riverbank erosion and thaw slumps. In contrast, lowland rivers of the central and eastern MRB contribute larger shares of dissolved Hg (up to 78 %), likely from recent atmospheric deposition through precipitation. Using load modelling constrained by the new water quality dataset, we estimate that the three largest western tributaries (Liard, Peel and Arctic Red rivers) of the Mackenzie contribute 60 % of the annual MRB THg export and DHg export to the Beaufort Sea during freshet, as well as 51 % of DHg export, while supplying 60 % of freshet discharge. Load modelling also reveals a sustained decline in DHg loads of ~13 kg yr(-1) between 2001 and 2016 in the lower Mackenzie River, which likely reflect a decreasing trend in atmospheric Hg deposition over most of northwestern Canada during this period. This study highlights the value of community-based water quality monitoring in helping to support assessments of riverine Hg in the MRB in support of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.},

Here, we report large and rapid fluctuations in deep porewater CO(2) concentration recurring every autumn over four consecutive years in a boreal peatland. Estimates of the vertical diffusion of heat indicate that CO(2) diffusion occurs at the turbulent rather than molecular rate. The weakening of porewater thermal stratification in autumn likely increases turbulent diffusion, thus fostering a rapid diffusion of deeper porewater CO(2) towards the surface where net losses occur. This phenomenon periodically decreases the peat porewater CO(2) store by between 29 and 90 g C m(-2) throughout autumn, which is comparable to the peatland's annual C-sink. Our results establish the need to consider the role of turbulent diffusion in regularly destabilizing the CO(2) store in peat porewater.},

   abstract = {Abstract The rapid development of novel technologies to obtain high-frequency observations has provided new possibilities to observe and understand carbon cycling in inland waters. This study investigates carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics along a boreal soil-stream transect using a state-of-the-art dataset in combination with a spectral methodology to identify controls on stream CO2. The spectral decomposition of hourly observations revealed intermediate (multiday) to long-term (monthly) patterns across the upslope-riparian-stream continuum, with similar power law increases in CO2 concentration fluctuations with increasing period. High-frequency CO2 variabilities, specifically diel CO2 concentration fluctuations, were also identified at all locations, but were substantially amplified in the stream compared to in the riparian groundwater. Moreover, the spectral coherence between soil and stream CO2 fluctuations was inconsistent and restricted to episodic events. In contrast, we found a strong and consistent spectral coherence between the riparian groundwater level and stream CO2 concentration, indicating a hydrological control on stream CO2 dynamics. However, during some time spans even these patterns were obscured, suggesting that additional processes, such as CO2 evasion and in-stream metabolism, modulated the influence from riparian sources. The scales and patterns of temporal coherences (or lack thereof) between CO2 at different points in the catchment, as well as with other factors, e.g. groundwater levels and Photosyntethically Active Radiation, provide new perspectives on the range of processes governing stream CO2 dynamics. Thus, this study highlights the potential of using spectral decomposition of high-resolution, spatially distributed data of different types to investigate biogeochemical transformations and pathways linking terrestrial and aquatic systems.},

While there are strong indications that groundwater inputs sustain these emissions, the specific biogeochemical pathways and timescales involved in this lateral CO(2) export are still obscure. Here, via an extensive radiocarbon ((14)C) characterisation of CO(2) and DOC in stream water and its groundwater sources in an old-growth boreal forest, we demonstrate that the (14)C-CO(2) is consistently in tune with the current atmospheric (14)C-CO(2) level and shows little association with the (14)C-DOC in the same waters. Our findings thus indicate that stream CO(2) emissions act as a shortcut that returns CO(2) recently fixed by the forest vegetation to the atmosphere. Our results expose a positive feedback mechanism within the C budget of forested catchments, where stream CO(2) emissions will be highly sensitive to changes in forest C allocation patterns associated with climate and land-use changes.},

These data were combined with an empirically derived gas transfer model and the characteristics of a ca. 400,000 km stream network covering the entire country. The total stream CO2 and CH4 emission corresponded to 2.7 Tg C yr−1 (95% confidence interval: 2.0–3.7) of which the CH4 accounted for 0.7% (0.02 Tg C yr−1). The study highlights the importance of low-order streams, as well as the critical need to better represent variability in emissions and stream areal extent to constrain future stream C emission estimates.},

   abstract = {Large CO2 evasion to the atmosphere occurs as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is transported from soils to streams. While this physical process has been the focus of multiple studies, less is known about the underlying biogeochemical transformations that accompany this transfer of C from soils to streams. Here we used patterns in stream water and groundwater C-13-DIC values within three headwater catchments with contrasting land cover to identify the sources and processes regulating DIC during its transport. We found that although considerable CO2 evasion occurs as DIC is transported from soils to streams, there were also other processes affecting the DIC pool. Methane production and mixing of C sources, associated with different types and spatial distribution of peat-rich areas within each catchment, had a significant influence on the C-13-DIC values in both soils and streams. These processes represent an additional control on C-13-DIC values and the catchment-scale cycling of DIC across different northern landscape types. The results from this study demonstrate that the transport of DIC from soils to streams results in more than just rapid CO2 evasion to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of C transformation, which questions some of our current conceptualizations of C cycling at the landscape scale. Plain Language Summary Large carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere occurs as rainwater percolates through soils and into streams. This physical process is important for the global carbon cycle and has been the focus of multiple studies. However, less is known about the underlying processes that accompanies this transfer of carbon dioxide from soils to streams. Here we analyze the stable isotope composition of soil and stream carbon dioxide and demonstrate that methane production and mixing of carbon sources also occur in soils and streams. These processes were linked to different types and configurations of peat-rich areas, for example, bogs, fens, and riparian zones, found within each of the three studied catchments. Our results therefore demonstrate that the export of carbon dioxide from soils to streams not only results in emissions to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of transformation. This questions some of our current conceptualization of the catchment-scale cycling of carbon dioxide.},

We found that stream DIC is governed by a variety of sources and sinks including biogenic and geogenic sources, CO(2) evasion, as well as in-stream processes. Although soil respiration was the main source of DIC across all streams, a geogenic DIC influence was identified in the northernmost region. All streams were affected by various degrees of atmospheric CO(2) evasion, but residual variance in delta(13)C-DIC also indicated a significant influence of in-stream metabolism and anaerobic processes. Due to those multiple sources and sinks, we emphasize that simply quantifying aquatic DIC fluxes will not be sufficient to characterise their role in the global C cycle.},

The aquatic export of C from boreal peatlands is recognized as both a critical pathway for the remobilization of peat C stocks as well as a major component of the net ecosystem C balance (NECB). Here, we present a full year characterization of radiocarbon content ((14) C) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO(2) ), and methane (CH(4) ) exported from a boreal peatland catchment coupled with (14) C characterization of the catchment's peat profile of the same C species. The age of aquatic C in runoff varied little throughout the year and appeared to be sustained by recently fixed C from the atmosphere (<60 years), despite stream DOC, CO(2) , and CH(4) primarily being sourced from deep peat horizons (2-4 m) near the mire's outlet. In fact, the (14) C content of DOC, CO(2) , and CH(4) across the entire peat profile was considerably enriched with postbomb C compared with the solid peat material. Overall, our results demonstrate little to no mobilization of ancient C stocks from this boreal peatland and a relatively large resilience of the source of aquatic C export to forecasted hydroclimatic changes.},

Identifying spatially explicit flowpaths, 2. Quantifying water residence time, and 3. Quantifying and localizing biogeochemical transformation. In this review, we synthesize the history of hydrological and biogeochemical theory, summarize modem tracer methods, and discuss how improved understanding of flowpath, residence time, and biogeochemical transformation can help ecohydrology move beyond description of site-specific heterogeneity. We focus on using multiple tracers with contrasting characteristics (crossing proxies) to infer ecosystem functioning across multiple scales. Specifically, we present how crossed proxies could test recent ecohydrological theory, combining the concepts of hotspots and hot moments with the Damkohler number in what we call the HotDam framework.

   abstract = {Boreal rivers and streams are known as hot spots of CO2 emissions, yet their contribution to CH4 emissions has traditionally been assumed to be negligible, due to the spatially fragmented data and lack of regional studies addressing both gases simultaneously. Here we explore the regional patterns in river CO2 and CH4 concentrations (pCO(2) and pCH(4)), gas exchange coefficient (k), and the resulting emissions in a lowland boreal region of Northern Quebec. Rivers and streams were systematically supersaturated in both gases, with both pCO(2) and pCH(4) declining along the river continuum. The k was on average low and increased with stream order, consistent with the hydrology of this flat landscape. The smallest streams (order 1), which represent <20% of the total river surface, contributed over 35% of the total fluvial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The end of winter and the spring thaw periods, which are rarely included in annual emission budgets, contributed on average 21% of the annual GHG emissions. As a whole, the fluvial network acted as significant source of both CO2 and CH4, releasing on average 1.5 tons of C (CO2 eq) yr(-1)km(-2) of landscape, of which CH4 emissions contributed approximately 34%. We estimate that fluvial CH4 emissions represent 41% of the regional aquatic (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) CH4 emissions, despite the relatively small riverine surface (4.3% of the total aquatic surface). We conclude that these fluvial networks in boreal lowlands play a disproportionately large role as hot spots for CO2 and more unexpectedly for CH4 emissions.},

   abstract = {It is now widely accepted that boreal rivers and streams are regionally significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), yet their role as methane (CH4) emitters, as well as the sensitivity of these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to climate change, are still largely undefined. In this study, we explore the large-scale patterns of fluvial CO2 and CH4 partial pressure (pCO2 , pCH4) and gas exchange (k) relative to a set of key, climate-sensitive river variables across 46 streams and rivers in two distinct boreal landscapes of Northern Quebec. We use the resulting models to determine the direction and magnitude of C-gas emissions from these boreal fluvial networks under scenarios of climate change. River pCO2 and pCH4 were positively correlated, although the latter was two orders of magnitude more variable. We provide evidence that in-stream metabolism strongly influences the dynamics of surface water pCO2 and pCH4 , but whereas pCO2 is not influenced by temperature in the surveyed streams and rivers, pCH4 appears to be strongly temperature-dependent. The major predictors of ambient gas concentrations and exchange were water temperature, velocity, and DOC, and the resulting models indicate that total GHG emissions (C-CO2 equivalent) from the entire network may increase between by 13 to 68% under plausible scenarios of climate change over the next 50 years. These predicted increases in fluvial GHG emissions are mostly driven by a steep increase in the contribution of CH4 (from 36 to over 50% of total CO2 -equivalents). The current role of boreal fluvial networks as major landscape sources of C is thus likely to expand, mainly driven by large increases in fluvial CH4 emissions.},
