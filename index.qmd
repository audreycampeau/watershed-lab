## Welcome

The Watershed Lab is an interdisciplinary research group studying watershed processes, with focus on biogeochemistry and hydrology. We want to understand how watershed processes operate, and how they may respond to and shape environmental changes.

What is a watershed? It is the geospatial scale that is defined by the natural flow of water on land. This scale provides a unit for understanding flows of matter and physical processes on land. It's greatest strenght is its interconnecteness - one effect upstream can be perceived over kilometers downstreams.

Our research is based mostly on field observations and combines multiple tools including automated and continuous *in-situ* sensor measurements, isotopic tracers, ground or drone-based imagery including, RGB, thermal infrared images and LIDAR.

We are based at the [departement of geography of University of Montréal](https://geographie.umontreal.ca/accueil/), located at Campus-MIL

## How to use this website

This websites serves as a **diffusion platform** for the research we do collectively in the lab. Here, you will find:
