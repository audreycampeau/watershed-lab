## Bio

::::: grid
::: g-col-8
Hi 👋 I'm Audrey,

I am an assistant professor in physical geography at the department of geography at the Université de Montréal 🇨🇦. I specialize in watershed biogeochemistry and hydrology. My research focuses on headwater catchments, those that have the strongest land-water connectivity💧.

I am fascinated with data visualization and I love the endless possibilities that programming can offer. I am a strong advocate for open and FARE science.

My personal time is devoted to my three young children 🚸. When I can find time for myself, I like to spend it on creation 🎨 and the outdoors 🥾. I love all textile arts! If you see me wearing something woolly, I probably made it 🧶

## Teaching

I teach several courses at the department including the first field course (Terrain 1 \| [GEO1315](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/geo-1315/)), the watershed course (Bassins Versants \| [GEO3162](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/geo-3162/)) and the ecosystem dynamics course (Dynamiques des Écosystèmes \| [GEO6100](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/geo-6100/)).

You can visualise the data collected for the physical geography portion of the field courses 👇 across different editions. Those reports were produced in collaboration with students and grad-students as part of individual projects using R programming and Quarto.
